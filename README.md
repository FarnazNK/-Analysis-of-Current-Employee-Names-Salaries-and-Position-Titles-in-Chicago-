In this repository, I have performed a data analysis to understand the current employee salaries and their distribution across different companies and job titles. The analysis was performed using SQL and I have answered the following questions:

What is the average salary for each job title?
How many employees are there in each company?
What is the average number of employees in each company?
What is the distribution of job titles in each company?
How does the salary vary between different job titles within the same company?
Are there any companies that pay significantly higher or lower salaries compared to others?
which job titles in companies have the highest average
The results of the analysis were obtained through SQL queries and were presented in a clear and concise manner for easy understanding. I believe this analysis will be valuable for HR departments, executives, and employees looking to understand the current state of salaries in different companies and job titles.
